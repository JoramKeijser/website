## Two Postdoc positions in Computational Neuroscience
Applications are invited for two PostDoc positions, working on computational models of network dynamics and synaptic plasticity.

Excellent command of English and good team spirit are essential. Duties will include contributions to the research activities of the laboratory. Engagement in teaching is possible, but not required. The salary is commensurate with experience, but relatively competitive (TV-L E13 100%).
