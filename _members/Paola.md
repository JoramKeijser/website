Interested in an integrated understanding of cognitive processes, Paola joined the group for a lab rotation that developed into her master thesis in May 2018. Her path into Neuroscience began while studying Biology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where she wrote a diploma thesis about synaptic integration in striatal neurons. Striving to bridge gaps between experimental and theoretical neuroscience, she later joined the master program in Computational Neuroscience at the Bernstein Center Berlin. In the lab, Paola explores the role of biophysical properties in decision-making networks using computational simulations and neurometric analysis.
