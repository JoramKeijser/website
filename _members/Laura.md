Laura Naumann studied Mathematics in Medicine and Life Science at Universität zu Lübeck. After finishing her bachelor’s degree in 2014 she joined the master program Computational Neuroscience at the Bernstein Center in Berlin. During her studies she visited the group for a lab rotation and later master thesis exploring the computational consequences of different inhibitory circuits. Following the master’s degree Laura began her doctoral studies in April 2017. She is investigating the functional implications of presynaptic inhibition in recurrent networks using mathematical analyses and numerical simulations.
