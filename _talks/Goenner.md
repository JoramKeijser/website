Hippocampal place-cell sequences observed during awake immobility often represent previous spatial experiences, but have recently also been linked to path planning in a memory-guided navigation task. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We present a model for the generation of place-cell sequences biased to progress towards known rewarded locations, capable of inferring novel paths across familiar terrain. These sequences can direct navigation towards changing goals. The model relies on two main computational properties: First, continuous attractor dynamics during sharp-wave ripples generate sequential activity of place cells, progressing toward the peak location of spatially heterogeneous input to CA3. Second, the heterogeneity in CA3 inputs is caused by reward-modulated plasticity at the dendrites of dentate granule cells. In contrast to sequence learning-based accounts of hippocampal replay, sequential activity in our model does not require previous experience of the corresponding trajectories. The model provides 1) a mechanistic account of goal-anticipating place-cell sequences in open-field mazes, 2) a functional hypothesis on their role in memory-guided decision-making, and 3) a prediction for the involvement of learning in the development of place-cell sequences.
