Synaptic inhibition plays a key role in shaping the dynamics of neuronal networks in the brain. Typically, an inhibitory axon contacts a particular dendritic subdomain of its target neuron, where it often makes 10–20 synapses, sometimes on very distal branches.  Despite the detailed anatomical characterization, the functional consequences of such inhibitory organization are not well understood. In this experimentally based theoretical study we highlight several counterintuitive design principles for dendritic inhibition; that distal “off-path” rather than proximal “on-path” inhibition effectively dampens proximal excitable dendritic “hotspots,” thus powerfully controlling the neuron’s output. Additionally, with multiple synaptic contacts, inhibition operates globally, spreading centripetally hundreds of micrometers from the inhibitory synapses. Using these principles we explored two structural extremities which serve as strategic loci for highly specific targeting of synaptic inhibition; dendritic spines, specialized dendritic protrusions receiving synaptic excitatory inputs, and the axon initial segment, where the neuronal output is generated. Our results challenge a widely accepted view that inhibitory structural specificity necessarily leads to a highly localized inhibitory impact and identify the conditions whereby this anatomical precision have a functional advantage.
