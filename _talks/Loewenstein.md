I will present two computational models that provide a quantitative description of learning behavior of humans and animals in operant learning tasks. The first model posits that the brain maintaining a set of estimates of expected returns whereas the second model is based on direct policy search. I will discuss how different synaptic plasticity rules can give rise to such learning algorithms and compare their behavioral predictions. If time allows, I will discuss the application of these models to explain learning behavior in professional basketball.
