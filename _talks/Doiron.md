The wiring of cortex is overwhelmingly complex.  In particular, the circuit structure of cortical networks has both an over and under representation of certain motifs, compared to unstructured networks. This structure is not hardwired, yet rather emerges from experience-dependent plasticity rules that govern the synaptic connections between cells.  A majority of theoretical studies of plastic networks consider the effect of external training on shaping network architecture.  We study the complementary situation of how a recurrent network with plastic synapses interacts with spontaneous spiking dynamics to create self-organized network structure.  We propose a self-consistent analysis that combines fast spike-time correlations computed using a linear response framework, with an adiabatic theory for synaptic weight dynamics.  We use this approach derive a theory for the evolutions of network architecture.  With a finite size expansion of network dynamics we obtain a closed set of nonlinear differential equations for the evolution of three-cell motif structure within the network.  With this theory in hand we give a principled exploration of how the details of the plasticity rule drives the evolution of micro- and macro-circuit structure in cortical networks.
