Confronted with the continuous flow of experience, the brain takes amorphous sensory inputs and translates them into coherent objects and scenes. This process requires      neural circuits to extract statistical regularities from their inputs and to use these regularities to interpret novel experience. It is generally accepted that such learning is supported by a variety of plasticity mechanisms, which change the properties of synapses and neurons at different temporal and spatial scales. Nonetheless, we still do not fully understand how different forms of plasticity contribute to learning.

During the talk I will describe a top-down approach to studying the interaction between different forms of plasticity during unsupervised learning. We start by defining a generative model for the inputs, after which we derive from first principles the configuration of plasticity mechanisms that implement optimal learning for such data. Our results reveal that Hebbian synaptic plasticity, synaptic scaling and intrinsic plasticity need to interact for efficient learning. More generally, the framework provides mathematically tractable way to study the interaction between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity and reveals new insights into how and why biological neurons change their excitability in response to experience.
