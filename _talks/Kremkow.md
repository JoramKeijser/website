The dynamic interaction of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the neuronal circuits of the brain forms the basis for sensory processing, perception and behavior. In the first part of this talk I will discuss theoretical work showing how the balance of excitation and inhibition and its temporal correlation form a powerful mechanism to control signal propagation along signaling pathways in the brain. In the second part of this talk I will then present experimental examples that highlight how these mechanisms are utilized in the neuronal circuits of the visual and somatosensory system in vivo.
