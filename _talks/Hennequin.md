Populations of neurons in motor cortex engage in complex transient dynamics of large amplitude during the execution of limb movements. Traditional, randomly connected balanced networks cannot reproduce this behavior. I will introduce a class of cortical architectures with strong and random excitatory recurrence that is stabilized by intricate, fine-tuned inhibition, optimized from a control theory perspective. Such networks are "nonnormal" in the mathematical sense, thus transiently amplifying specific network states into spatially and temporally complex activity transients. I will show that selective amplification can be used to reliably execute multidimensional movement patterns; I will also give a brief tutorial on some of the mathematical tools used in other domains of engineering to characterize the nonnormal dynamics of such systems.
