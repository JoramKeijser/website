Long-term modifications in neuronal connections are critical for reliable memory storage in the brain. However, their locus of expression -- pre- or postsynaptic -- is highly variable and the origin of this variability is poorly understood. In this talk I will present a new theoretical framework in which long-term plasticity performs an optimisation of the postsynaptic response statistics towards a given mean. Consequently, the state of the synapse at the time of plasticity induction determines the ratio of pre- and postsynaptic modifications. Our theory explains the observed variability in expression loci of all the individual hippocampal and neocortical synaptic potentiation experiments we tested. Moreover, the theory predicts presynaptic expression of long-term depression experiments, consistent with experimental observations. At inhibitory synapses, the theory predicts a statistically efficient excitatory-inhibitory balance in which changes in inhibitory postsynaptic response statistics target the mean excitatory input. Our results provide a unifying theory for understanding the expression mechanisms and functions of long-term plasticity of synaptic transmission.
