The oculomotor integrator (OI) in the hindbrain transforms incoming horizontal eye movement commands into position signals to maintain stable eye fixations after saccades. Previous electrophysiological investigations of the system have led to the hypothesis that the OI has a continuum of stable stationary states, giving rise to a continuous attractor network. Here, we combine network modelling and optogenetics in the OI of zebrafish, to unveil the dynamics of OI outside of the normal regime, and show how it poses new constraints on the circuit connectivity of the system. (Joint work with Aristides Arrenberg, Bastian Hablitzel, Herwig Baier and Christian Machens).
