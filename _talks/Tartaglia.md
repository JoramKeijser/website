Over short time periods, memories are stored by sustained patterns of spiking activity which, once initiated by the stimulus, persist over the entire retention interval. How the information stored by such persistent activity is later retrieved is presently unclear. Here we propose that, besides temporarily storing memories, persistent activity is also instrumental in their retrieval by transiently modifying the tuning properties of the underlying neuronal networks. We show that the mechanism proposed parsimoniously recapitulates the extensive experimental phenomenology on match effects observed in delayed-response tasks, where the information held in memory has to be compared with incoming, sensory-related information to act appropriately. The theory makes very specific, straightforwardly testable predictions.
