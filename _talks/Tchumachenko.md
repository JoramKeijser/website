Despite recent experimental advances, understanding how connectivity and single neuron properties interact in neural circuits remains a mayor challenge in neurobiology. Neural firing rates and their dependence on external inputs can be measured in individual neurons or neural populations. However, how exactly neural firing rates are determined by recurrent interactions with local surrounding neurons and feed-forward inputs from distant upstream cortical areas is difficult to investigate with the state-of-the-art experimental methods. The inhibition stabilized network model put forward by previous studies offers an attractive alternative to balanced networks and describes networks in which neurons have low to medium firing rates that are consistent with experimental measurements. In such networks the firing rates of excitatory and inhibitory neurons are described by two coupled nonlinear differential equations and include a power law activation function for individual neurons. Here, we present the first complete solution showing that such the single-neuron non-linearity in such networks can lead to oscillations, persistent states and bistability as well as other forms of nonlinear computation.
