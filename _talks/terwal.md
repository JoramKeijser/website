Our brains function in an ever changing world. The inputs from our senses are never the same twice, and in addition, the appropriate response to an input depends on the context, such as our internal state, the task we are performing and the environment we are in.  The communication between neural circuits in the brain is therefore expected to be highly flexible. In this talk, I will discuss a model that utilizes synchronization of activity within and between neural circuits as a mechanism for dynamic communication in the brain. I will show that synchrony within a circuit creates windows of susceptibility to inputs, which in turn gives rise to synchrony- and phase-dependent transfer of information between connected circuits.
