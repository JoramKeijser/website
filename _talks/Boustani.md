GABAergic interneurons play a key role in shaping sensory processing and plasticity of the mature and developing brain. Interneurons can be divided into classes that differ in molecular, morphological and functional properties. Recent development of new mouse lines have allowed us to systematically study genetically defined cell-types. In particular, considerable attention has been drawn to parvalbumin-expressing (PV) and somatostatin-expressing (SOM) interneurons, the two key cell-types that target pyramidal neurons. Several studies have attributed immutable functions to these interneurons by showing that they inhibit the response of their targets through either of two fundamental arithmetic operations, namely subtraction or division. However opposite conclusions were reached leaving the problem partly unresolved. We addressed this issue by using precisely timed optogenetic manipulation in combination with two-photon calcium imaging or targeted electrophysiology. We showed experimentally and with computational models that the function of these interneurons can adapt to the stimulus ensemble used to characterize them. In particular, SOM interneurons effect on target cells can either be divisive or subtractive depending on the size of the visual stimulus presented. This more general description of interneuron functions was used to reconcile divergent previous results.
